Explanation:
SQLite Database: We are using an SQLite database to store the student information. The database is created (if it doesnâ€™t exist) and includes columns for student_id, name, age, course, and grade.
Functions: Each function serves a specific purpose:
add_student(): Adds a new student to the database.
view_students(): Displays all students.
update_student(): Updates a student record by ID.
delete_student(): Deletes a student record by ID.
search_student_by_name(): Searches for students by name.
Main Menu: The main() function presents a user interface to perform the operations.
Running the System:
Run the Python script.
A menu will appear where you can choose to add, view, update, delete, or search student records.
Enter the corresponding details when prompted.
This is a simple implementation and can be expanded further with validation, error handling, or additional features.
